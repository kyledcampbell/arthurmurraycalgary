        I initially only joined to learn a few latin moves for a trip and was immediately hooked. The experience of the teachers, the friendly and welcoming atmosphere, and the incredibly supportive community have kept me coming back with no end in sight.
        Every teacher Iâ€™ve been privileged to learn from has contributed valuable knowledge and insight towards my growth as a dancer. The majority of my lessons have been with Chelsea who has been infinitely patient and kind throughout this journey.
        I can not recommend Arthur Murray enough.",

On a side note, I did my first dance competition in Las Vegas last year.  Was very pleased with my outcome and placement.  Overall a great experience, meeting new people, socializing and most of all a lot fun to do.",
