          Nothing short of life changing... The experience of the teachers, the
          friendly and welcoming atmosphere, and the incredibly supportive
          community have kept me coming back with no end in sight. Every teacher
          Iâ€™ve been privileged to learn from has contributed valuable knowledge
          and insight towards my growth as a dancer... I can not recommend
          Arthur Murray enough.

          Very friendly teachers with a lot of experience. Everyone is eager to
          help you with new techniques. Dance parties are great way to practice
          what you have learned... I did my first dance competition in Las Vegas
          last year. Was very pleased with my outcome and placement. Overall a
          great experience, meeting new people, socializing and most of all a
          lot fun to do.

          My wife and I have not danced since our wedding night 30 years ago. A
          few minutes into our introductory lesson I realized what a mistake
          that has been. Our instructor put us at ease and had us moving in no
          time with her energy and enthusiasm for dance. Can't wait to start our
          full variety pack of lessons!
